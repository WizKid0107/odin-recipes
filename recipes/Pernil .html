    <li>9 pounds skin-on, bone-in pork shoulder (picnic) roast</li>
    <li>1 medium lime, halved</li>
    <li>10 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>2 ½ tablespoons salt</li>
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 ¼ teaspoons adobo seasoning (such as Goya®)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vinegar</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon sazon seasoning</li>
    <li>2 (12 fluid ounce) cans or bottles beer (such as Budweiser®)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Rub pork shoulder all over with lime.</li>
    <li>Mash garlic into a paste with a mortar and pestle, then transfer to a bowl.</li>
    <li>Mix in salt, 1 tablespoon oil, oregano, pepper, adobo seasoning, and vinegar until well combined</li>
    <li>Pull the skin back to within 1 inch from the narrow part of the bone.</li>
    <li>Make 3/4-inch slits all over the pork with a sharp knife.</li>
    <li>Stuff seasoned garlic paste into the slits, then pull the skin back into place.</li>
    <li>Mix remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil with sazón seasoning in a small bowl.</li>
     <li>Rub all over the skin.</li>
    <li>Transfer pork to a large roasting pan. Pour beer into the pan, then cover with aluminum foil, sealing well.</li>
    <li>Roast in the preheated oven until pork is slightly pink in the center, about 3 hours. Increase the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Uncover and continue roasting until the skin is golden brown and crispy, about 2 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before carving.</li>
